CodeClan Solo Ruby Project: Gym Manager

A back-of-house app aimed at helping a gym manager administrate their gym. The brief required us to make a web app using Ruby, Sinatra and a SQL relational database. It allows a user to add, edit and delete gym members, create gym classes and also book members into gym classes, as long as the class is not at maximum capacity.
